# Iris Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis & Preprocessing

This project presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing pipeline for the classic **Iris dataset** using Python.  
The objective is to prepare the data for machine learning by cleaning, visualizing, handling outliers, and scaling features.

## 📦 Project Highlights

- Overview and structure of the dataset  
- Detection of missing values and duplicate records  
- Outlier identification using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method  
- Data visualization to uncover feature relationships and correlations  
- Feature standardization using `StandardScaler`  
- Dataset split into training and testing sets for machine learning readiness
