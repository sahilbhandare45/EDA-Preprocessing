# 🌸 Iris Dataset – EDA & Preprocessing Project

This is a simple exploratory data analysis project on the Iris dataset using Python.  
The goal was to clean the data, visualize patterns, handle outliers, and scale the features — basically getting the dataset ready for any future machine learning work.
